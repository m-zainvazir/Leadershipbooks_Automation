/**
 * lib-help.mjs — every step, and every problem, explained in plain words.
 *
 * Muhammad, 2026-10-02: "isn't it possible for this dashboard to provide me an
 * easy explanation, and provide me steps on what to do … for all the 17 steps,
 * wherever, whenever stuck."
 *
 * So for each step: what it is, why it matters, how to do it (numbered, with
 * where to click), and how you know it is done. And for each thing the live
 * checks can find wrong: what is wrong, in plain words, and the exact steps to
 * fix it — with THIS author's links, names and ids filled in.
 *
 * Pure, written once, no AI, costs nothing. Uses only public values — never a key.
 * Plan: ../ghl-shopify subscription/plans/22-pipeline-dashboard.md §16.
