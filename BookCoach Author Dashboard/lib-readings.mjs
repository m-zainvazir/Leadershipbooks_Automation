/**
 * lib-readings.mjs — the last reading of each author, kept between runs
 * (Muhammad, 2026-10-06). Reading the live systems took ~50 s for six authors
 * and grows with every new one, so the dashboard opens on the LAST reading and
 * reads again only what Refresh names: everything, the authors ticked, or the
 * one author open in the Onboard tab.
 *
 * Kept in readings.local.json (gitignored), one entry per author plus one for
 * the health checks. An entry is used only while
 *   - the step list is the one it was read with — a reorder would put every
 *     cell under the wrong step, so the whole file is dropped
 *   - its inputs are unchanged: for an author, the coaches.json entry, the
 *     sign-offs and the last end-to-end test. Change one (`author set`, a
 *     sign-off from the terminal) and that author alone is read again.
 * When the CHECKS changed since (the dashboard was updated), the entry is still
 * shown — marked oldChecks, so the page can say "Refresh to see the new checks".
 *
 * Only the inputs' fingerprint is stored, never the inputs; and nothing is
 * written that carries a credential.
